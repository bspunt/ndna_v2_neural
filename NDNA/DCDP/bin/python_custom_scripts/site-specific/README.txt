All python scripts directly inside this directory are "DataCenter" e.g. site specific. The script will prompt you for the site/DataCenter to run it on.

e.g. New York, London, Los Angeles, etc.

It will then look to the correct IP List for that DataCenter.

All other custom scripts inside other sub-folders, e.g. 
enterprise-wide-routers, etc... relate to non-datacenter specific.

See user guide and/or README's in those folders.
